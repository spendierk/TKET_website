What is TKET?
==============

TKET is an open-source SDK designed for gate-based quantum computers. It compiles and optimizes quantum circuits, ensuring compatibility and high performance on various quantum devices and simulators. With the challenges of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, TKET stands out in mitigating device constraints and noise for accurate results.

- **Use Cases**: These represent specific tasks or challenges one might want to address using quantum computing, like machine learning, chemistry, or optimization problems.
- **Applications Software**: At this layer, specialized algorithms, such as the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), are created to generate quantum circuits using a universal set of gates.
- **Quantum Circuit**: Represents the raw quantum algorithm with universal gatesets. Here, you can visualize algorithms like QFT as they are intended to operate at a high level.
- **TKET Optimization**: A critical phase where quantum circuits are refined and optimized considering specific quantum hardware constraints. These constraints include limited qubit connectivity, native gatesets (e.g., ECR, ID, RZ, SX, X), and error rates.
- **Quantum Simulator**: Before running a quantum algorithm on an actual quantum processor, it can be tested on a quantum simulator. This software tool mimics the behavior of a quantum computer, allowing developers to understand potential outcomes, troubleshoot issues, and refine algorithms without directly using quantum hardware.
- **Hardware Translation**: Once the circuit is optimized with tools like TKET, it is translated into machine code that quantum processors (QPUs) understand. This code can be directly executed on QPUs or simulated using quantum simulators.
- **Quantum Processor**: This is the hardware layer where the quantum computations physically take place. Quantum circuits in machine code are executed on these quantum processing units to get the desired results.

- **Quantum Compiler**: TKET, underpinned by a high-performance C++ library, is a high-performance compiler that tailors quantum circuits to the constraints of specific quantum hardware and simulators. Within TKET's C++ core, quantum circuits are rewritten, device constraints are solved, and optimization is performed.
- **Platform Agnostic**: TKET can target a variety of quantum processing units (QPUs) and simulators. This is where quantum circuits are executed. Cloud access through specific platforms is also available.
- **Integration with Libraries**: TKET is compatible with popular quantum libraries, offering the ability to build circuits seamlessly.
- **Python Interface**: TKET is accessible through its Python frontend package, ``pytket``, available on GitHub and installed with the command ``pip install pytket``. For any difficulties with installation, please consult our `troubleshooting <https://cqcl.github.io/tket/pytket/api/install.html>`_ page.
- **Extension Modules**: ``pytket`` `extensions <https://cqcl.github.io/pytket-extensions/api/index.html>`_ facilitate connections to various backends, representing links to QPUs or simulators. Cloud extensions further enhance access to platforms like Azure and Braket. Additionally, these modules support the cross-compilation of circuits from popular quantum libraries, seamlessly integrating ``pytket``'s compilation strengths with other software tools.
